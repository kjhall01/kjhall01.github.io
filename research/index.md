## Research Interest

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Geography under the supervision of [Dr. Guido Cervone](https://www.geog.psu.edu/directory/guido-cervone) in the [Geoinformatics and Earth Observation Laboratory](http://geoinf.psu.edu/).

Below is a list of my research keywords:

- Ensemble Weather Forecasting
- Uncertainty Quantification for Renewable Energy
- Artificial Intelligence
- High Performance Computing

My Ph.D. thesis title is *Uncertainty Quantification for Photovoltaic Energy Production Using Analog Ensemble*. I'm investigating the predictability of photovoltaic solar energy production over the Continental US. The uncertainty of solar energy production not only comes from the variation of solar irradiance, but also other weather conditions together with the configuration of the particular energy performance system. I'm using [Analog Ensemble](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble) to study the spatial and temporal predictability of photovoltaic solar energy generation.

Please see my [CV](https://weiming-hu.github.io/assets/pdf/Hu-Weiming-CV.pdf) for more information.

I also maintain a curated list of posts that showcase my research and document my research experiences [here](https://weiming-hu.github.io/tags/). Comments are well welcome.

## Programming

I have been actively developing and maintaining the following packages and code repositories. They are developed during my current and previous courses of research. Some of them were converted into packages for a broader research community.

- [Parallel Analog Ensemble](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/) (C++/R)
- [RAnEnExtra](https://weiming-hu.github.io/RAnEnExtra/) (R)
- [Solar Photovoltaic Energy Simulator](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/RenewableSimulator) (Python)
- [EITrans: Empirical Inverse Transform Function](https://weiming-hu.github.io/EITrans/) (R)
- [More Parallel R](https://weiming-hu.github.io/MoreParallelR/) (R)
