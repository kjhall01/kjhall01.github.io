## Research Interest

I am a climate data scientist seeking to increase societyâ€™s resilience against climate change and climate variability by contributing to the improvement of quantitative climate forecasting and climate modeling. I received my M.A. in Climate & Society at Columbia University with the International Research Institute for Climate & Society, and my B.S. in Computer Science at the College of William & Mary, specializing in AI/ML and data science methods.

Research Keywords:

- Geospatial Data Science 
- Artificial Intelligence
- High Performance Computing
- Machine Learning 
- Climate Forecasting
