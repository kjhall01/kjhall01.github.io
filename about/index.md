I'm a Ph.D. candidate of [The Geoinformatics and Earth Observation Laboratory (GEOlab)](http://geoinf.psu.edu/) in [The Department of Geography](https://www.geog.psu.edu/) at [Penn State University](http://www.psu.edu/) focusing on Geoscience, Computational Algorithm, and High-Performance Computing.

I received a Bachelor in Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) majoring in Remote Sensing and GIScience in 2016 and an Master of Science from [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) majoring in Geography in 2018. Now I'm continuing my Ph.D. study in uncertainty quantification for photovoltaic solar energy production forecast.

I have been actively developing and maintaining the following packages:

- [Parallel Analog Ensemble](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/)
- [EITrans: Empirical Inverse Transform Function](https://weiming-hu.github.io/EITrans/)
- [More Parallel R](https://weiming-hu.github.io/MoreParallelR/)
